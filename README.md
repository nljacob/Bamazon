<h1>Bamazon</h1>

<p>Bamazon is a CLI, Amazon-like storefront, created with JavaScript and MYSQL. It allows users to view items available in the store, make a purchase, and then deplete stock from the store's inventory.</p>

<p>Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. The user is then prompted to enter the ID number of the item they want to purchase. Once the user enters the ID number, another prompt asks how many of the items they would like to purchase. If the item is not in stock, the user will receive a message that lets them know that there is not enough in stock and the items available are displayed again with the initial prompt. If the item is in stock, the user will see the total cost and the stock quantity gets updated in the database. This completes the transaction and the user is asked if they would like to purchase another item.</p>
